### Hello World, my name is PeterðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a tic tac toe squared game! Say goodbye to 10 second games that always lead to a tie.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning computing systems, python, and machine learning.
- ðŸ‘¯ Looking to collaborate on backend development projects.

- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about any of my projects :) Be careful, once I start sharing, I might not be able to stop!
