**pmh-3/pmh-3** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a tic tac toe squared game! Say goodbye to 10 second games that always lead to a tie.
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning computing systems, python, and databases.
- ğŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on backend development projects.

- ğŸ’¬ Ask me about any of my projects! Be careful, I might not stop sharing my excitement.

- âš¡ if im not programming, then you can find me exploring the outdoors
